Job Description: DevOps Engineer
===

**Organizational Overview:**
[SparkMeter](www.sparkmeter.io) is a venture-backed company that was founded in late 2013, a spin-off of the non-profit [EarthSpark International](www.earthsparkinternational.org). We developed our low-cost, pre-pay enabled, smart metering system as a solution for electric utilities in developing countries to serve low-income customers. A deployed system of 430 meters has been running on a microgrid in rural Haiti since October 2013, and nearly 1,000 meters are coming online on microgrids in Tanzania, India, and Nepal by December 2015. SparkMeter is now finalizing the next version of its system for first commercial deployments.

SparkMeter is a small, well-funded startup and is looking for people who are leaders and self-starters. As a company with a growing team, you should be willing to grow with the company, find new roles, and will be critical in making new hires to further expand the team. Our work is highly dynamic and frequently evolving, a necessary response to the requirements of serving customers in emerging markets.
